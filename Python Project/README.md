# 🏅 Olympic Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Olympic Games data to uncover insights, patterns, and trends across various dimensions such as athlete performance, country rankings, gender participation, and event popularity. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 🚀 Objective
- Understand historical trends in Olympic Games.
- Analyze country-wise performance and identify top-performing nations.
- Explore athlete demographics and gender representation.
- Visualize key insights using meaningful plots and charts.
