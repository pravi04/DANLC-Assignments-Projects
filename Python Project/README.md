# 🏅 Olympic Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Olympic Games data to uncover insights, patterns, and trends across various dimensions such as athlete performance, country rankings, gender participation, and event popularity. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

---

## 🚀 Objective
- Understand historical trends in Olympic Games.
- Analyze country-wise performance and identify top-performing nations.
- Explore athlete demographics and gender representation.
- Visualize key insights using meaningful plots and charts.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis environment.

## 📑 EDA Process

### 1️⃣ **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Handled missing values and standardized column names.
- Ensured data consistency and accuracy.

### 2️⃣ **Data Exploration**
- Analyzed key metrics: total medals, athlete participation, and event counts.
- Explored patterns across different Olympic years and sports categories.

### 3️⃣ **Athlete Demographics**
- Investigated athlete age, gender distribution, and physical attributes (height, weight).
- Compared male and female participation across years.

### 4️⃣ **Country Performance Analysis**
- Identified top-performing countries by total medal count.
- Analyzed medal distribution across different sports.

### 5️⃣ **Event Insights**
- Studied the popularity of events over time.
- Visualized the most successful sports for different countries.

## Difference between the Notebooks

There are two primary Jupyter notebooks in this project, each handling the Olympics dataset in different ways:

1. [Olympic Data Analysis.ipynb](Olympic%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)  
   This notebook focuses on analyzing the dataset directly from the CSV file. It includes data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps, working with the raw CSV data.

2. [Olympics-EDA-SQL_DB.ipynb](Olympics-EDA%20SQL_DB.ipynb)  
   This notebook performs the same exploratory data analysis (EDA) as the first one but with a key difference. The dataset is now stored in an SQL database. The CSV file has been converted into a SQL format and inserted into the database as tables. This notebook retrieves data from the SQL database and performs the analysis, making it a more robust approach when handling large datasets or complex queries.
